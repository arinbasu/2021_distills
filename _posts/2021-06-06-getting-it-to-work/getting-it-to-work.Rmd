Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.

Learn more about using Distill at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>.

It is not very intuitive to set up a blog with Distill and run with Github Pages. 

## Steps
1. Start with a github repo
2. Clone it in Rstudio
3. Then `create_blog("cloned_repo")
4. Then click the individual page to be knitted

> You work on blog posts independent of the enclosing website (use Knit to render and preview the post just like any R Markdown document). This is in fact the only way to update post content â€” posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built. This is because posts are often expensive to render and have R package dependencies that may be difficult to satisfy as time goes on.
